NomNomNow is an online platform that allows users to search for restaurants in the area and leave reviews for their 
favorite, or not so favorite restaurants. NomNomNow also has a feature that allows the user to sit back and relax 
while a restaurant within two miles of the user is randomly chosen, if the user is unsatisfied with the choice they 
can easily ask for a new suggestion.

NomNomNow is built on a Ruby on Rails backend and the backend is built on JavaScript and Backbone.js with twitter bootstrap.
